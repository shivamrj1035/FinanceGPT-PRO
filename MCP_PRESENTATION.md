## 💡 Real Example

### Without MCP:
```
User: "What's my monthly payment for a $200,000 loan?"
Bot: "For a typical loan, it might be around $1,000-1,500"
```
❌ Vague, inaccurate

### With MCP:
```
User: "What's my monthly payment for a $200,000 loan?"
Bot: "For a $200,000 loan at 7% for 30 years:
      Monthly Payment: $1,330.60
      Total Interest: $279,016"
