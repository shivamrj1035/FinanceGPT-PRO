## üéØ How AI Models Are Currently Used

### **1. Fraud Detection** (Multiple Use Cases)
```python
# In API endpoints:
POST /api/v1/fraud/check
POST /api/v1/demo/trigger-fraud

# In MCP Tools:
- FraudDetector tool
- Real-time transaction monitoring
- Risk scoring with explanations
```

### **2. Investment Analysis**
```python
# In API endpoints:
GET /api/v1/investments
POST /api/v1/goals/optimize

# In MCP Tools:
- InvestmentAnalyzer tool
- PortfolioOptimizer tool
- GoalOptimizer tool
```

### **3. Spending Analysis**
```python
# In API endpoints:
POST /api/v1/transactions/analyze

# In MCP Tools:
- ExpenseTracker tool
- BudgetAnalyzer tool
- CashFlowAnalyzer tool
```

### **4. Credit Analysis**
```python
# In MCP Tools:
- CreditAnalyzer tool
- CreditScoreImprover tool
```

### **5. Chat & Insights**
```python
# In API endpoints:
POST /api/v1/chat
POST /api/v1/insights/generate

# Uses Gemini for:
- Context-aware responses
- Financial advice
- Concept explanations
```

## ‚ùå What Remains to Be Done

### **1. Full Integration with API Endpoints** (Priority: HIGH)
Currently, the AI models are created but not fully integrated into all API endpoints.

**Action Required:**
```python
# In api/main.py, need to add:
from ai_models import (
    fraud_detector,
    spending_analyzer,
    investment_engine,
    credit_predictor,
    get_gemini_analyzer
)

# Then update endpoints to use AI models instead of mock data
```

### **2. Enhanced MCP Tools Integration** (Priority: MEDIUM)
```python
# In mcp_server/tools.py, upgrade to use:
- Gemini CoT for all financial analysis
- Consistency checking for critical decisions
- Self-consistency for high-value transactions
```

### **3. Real-time WebSocket Integration** (Priority: MEDIUM)
```python
# Add AI-powered real-time features:
- Live fraud alerts with CoT explanations
- Real-time portfolio optimization
- Instant spending insights
```

### **4. Database Integration** (Priority: LOW)
```python
# Store AI predictions and insights:
- Save fraud scores in database
- Track prediction accuracy
- Store user preferences for AI
```

## üöÄ How to Use AI Models in Your Code

### **Example 1: Fraud Detection with CoT**
```python
from ai_models import get_gemini_analyzer

async def check_fraud_advanced(transaction):
    gemini = get_gemini_analyzer()

    # Use Chain-of-Thought for detailed analysis
    result = await gemini.analyze_fraud_with_cot(
        transaction=transaction,
        user_history=get_user_history()
    )

    # Result includes:
    # - risk_score (0-100)
    # - risk_level (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH/CRITICAL)
    # - reasoning_steps (step-by-step analysis)
    # - recommended_action (ALLOW/VERIFY/BLOCK)

    return result
```

### **Example 2: Investment Recommendations**
```python
from ai_models import get_gemini_analyzer

async def get_investment_advice(user_profile, goals):
    gemini = get_gemini_analyzer()

    # Use Few-Shot learning for personalized advice
    result = await gemini.analyze_investment_with_few_shot(
        user_profile=user_profile,
        goals=goals
    )

    # Result includes:
    # - asset_allocation (equity, debt, gold percentages)
    # - specific_recommendations (funds, stocks)
    # - sip_plan (monthly investment plan)
    # - tax_saving_instruments

    return result
```

### **Example 3: Self-Consistency for Critical Decisions**
```python
from ai_models import get_gemini_analyzer

async def make_critical_decision(query, context):
    gemini = get_gemini_analyzer()

    # Run multiple passes for consistency
    result = await gemini.analyze_with_self_consistency(
        query=query,
        context=context,
        passes=3  # Run 3 independent analyses
    )

    # Result includes:
    # - consensus_level (0.0-1.0)
    # - confidence_score
    # - aggregated recommendations

    return result
```

### **Example 4: Basic Models (No API Key Required)**
```python
from ai_models import fraud_detector, spending_analyzer

# Basic fraud detection
fraud_result = fraud_detector.predict(transaction, history)

# Spending analysis
spending_result = spending_analyzer.analyze(transactions)
```
